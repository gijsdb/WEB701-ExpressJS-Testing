# WEB701-ExpressJS & VueJS (and many other packages)

<p>This repository holds part of my work for Assignment 2, Milestone 2 for WEB701</p>

<p>I started off creating the criteria for each framework seperately. Eg. Individual directories for oAuth & Express and DataBase System. How ever I soon realised I would need to combine it all into one application to properly understand how it all worked together.</p>

<p>As I started combining features, I started struggling with combining the Google OAuth in Express with a VueJS frontend and the Hop items stored in my database so i decided to go with a local login system storing the users in my SQLite database.</p>
