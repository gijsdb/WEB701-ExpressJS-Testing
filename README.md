# WEB701-ExpressJS-Testing
I started off creating the criteria for each framework seperately. Eg. Individual directories for oAuth & Express and DataBase System. How ever I soon realised I would need to combine it all into one application to properly understand how it all worked together. 

As I started doing this started struggling with combining the Google OAuth in Express with a VueJS frontend and the Hop items stored in my database so i decided to go with a local login in my CombinedSystemV2.
